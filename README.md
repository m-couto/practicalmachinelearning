# Weight Lifting Quality

In this project we analyzed Human Activity Recognition data on the quality of weight lifting exercises. The analysis consisted on:
  - preprocessing, including intensive feature selection;
  - prediction with several classification models;
  - evaluation of these predictions.


The data can be found here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.
